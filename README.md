### Sorting algorithms 
1. Bubble sort 

Bubble sorting, sorting by simple exchanges, the method of sorting by exchanges is one of the sorting algorithms. Compared to other algorithms, it is considered the simplest to understand and implement. It is effective for arrays of small size. 

The algorithm is considered educational, in practice (outside of the educational literature) is not used (in practice, more efficient (perfect) algorithms are used). It is the basis of some more efficient algorithms, for example, the shaker sorting algorithm, the pyramid sorting algorithm and the quick sorting algorithm.

2. Quick sort 

Quick sort, Hoare sort, often called qsort (by name in the C Standard Library) is a sorting algorithm developed by English computer scientist Tony Hoare during his work at Moscow State University in 1960.

One of the fastest known universal array sorting algorithms: on average O(n log n) exchanges when ordering n elements; due to the presence of a number of disadvantages in practice, it is usually used with some modifications.
